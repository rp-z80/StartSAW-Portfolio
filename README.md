# StartSAW-Portfolio
The project I made for the Web Applications Development class, here as part of my portfolio.

This is a dynamic website, the assignment was to make a web application for a fake start-up. My group's idea was a start-up that develops music production softwares named "Harsh Noises".

The main functionalities of the website are:
- User registration and login
- An administration area, accessible only by users that have the admin permissions, that allows to ban and unban users, update the products list and send e-mails to users registred to the company mailing list (this part is made with phpmailer and an external API that allows to write formatted text)
- A "contact us" form

Here some screenshots:
