                <div class="sectionText">
                Back in the days, when we were active in the underground electronic music scene, we needed a very
                specific synth but we couldn't find anything like what we wanted. We decided to make it by ourselves: our first
                VST was born!

                <p>We've continued developing music production softwares for the last 5 years, we created one of the best
                DAW on the market and very powerful VSTs, all of this available for free. </p>  

                <p>In 2020 we decided to take the project to the next level and made it a startup: Harsh Noises Software.</p>

                <p>Our applications are used by thousands of people all around the world and you can find music made with 
                our softwares in videogames, YouTube videos, advertisings, indie albums and so on.</p>
